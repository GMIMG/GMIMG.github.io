https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/223#issuecomment-376816247


To summarize, here's a table of the boolean value of various values (jekyll 3.7.3, liquid 4.0.0):

Operator	nil	""	" "
var	false	true	true
var == blank	false	false	false
var == empty	false	true	false
var == ""	false	true	false
var == nil	true	false	false
Generated with statements like {%if Operator %}true{% else %}false{% endif %}

- Empty strings are "truthy", unlike in most languages
- No operator returns true for both undefined (nil) and empty strings. Use 'or' as suggested above (var == nil or var == empty)
- blank doesn't seem to work for strings. By analogy to the rails blank? operator, I would have expected both "" and " " to be blank, but liquid seems to only define it for certain custom datatypes.
