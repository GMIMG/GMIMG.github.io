# Transmission media

located below the physical layer and are directly controlled by the physical layer.

Carry information from a source to a destination.

Free space, metallic cable, or fiber-optic cable

## Guided media

- Twisted-pair cables
- Coaxial cables
- (Fiber-optic cable)

Provide a conduit(도관) from one device to another.

Signal traveling directed and contained by the physical limits of medium.

### Twisted-Pair Cable

Voice and data communications

One of the sires is used to carry signals to the receiver

The other is used only as a ground reference.

crosstalk(noise 발생)

꼬아줌으로서 balance 유지 -> 외부영향을 두선 모두 동등하게 받음

noise가 cancle.

- Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)
- Shielded twisted-pair(STP)

### Coaxial cable

Carries signal of higher frequency ranges

Cable TV networks and traditional Ethernet LANs

### Fiber-optic cables

Bacbone networks, cable TV networks, and Fast Ethernet networks

장점
- Higher bandwidth - Less signal attenuation - light weight

단점
- installation and maintenance - cost

## unguided media

Transport electromagnetic waves without the use of a physical conductor(free space)

- Radio waves
Multicast communications, such as radio, television, paging systems
- Microwaves
cellular phone, satellite, and wireless LAN
- (Infrared)
short-ange communication such as those between a PC, a peripheral device, indoor LAN, and remote control
